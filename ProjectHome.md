This idea of mine is to lock a computer remotely via a GSM service etc using a biometric device by its user so that he can protect the computer at the top level security. As hackers cant directly access the servers to steal data because of the hardware and software firewalls, their primary choice of attack would be on terminals. This project will pay attention to the corporate level mainntainance and also by an individual if deserved. There would be a GSM service that communicate with the computer remotely ie., wherever the user is, through a proper biometric device. With the key press, he will be able to stop the power supply flow into the motherboard from the SMPS so as to prevent the system from getting on. Similarly, he will send another signal to start the computer working normally and the lock gets released. For this to work, we need a device to communicate with the biometric gadget in the user hand and, control the computer. This device must be able to sit in the cabinet itself and the power for it is the CMOS battery that is existing in the computer itself.
